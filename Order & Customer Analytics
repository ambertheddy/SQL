##In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about order and customer data.##

1.How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid)=6 
AND orderid <> 'Order Id';

2.How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product = 'iphone'
AND length(orderid)=6 
AND orderid <> 'Order Id';

3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales sales
ON customers.order_id=sales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product,min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product,price
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1 ;

5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(price)*product AS revenue,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

6.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),AVG(price*quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales febsales
ON cust.order_id=Febsales.orderID
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

8.List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product,SUM(quantity) AS Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY Quantity DESC;
