7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),AVG(price*quantity)

WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

8.List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
